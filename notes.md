* Goals
	- [X] Finish the calculation implementation
    - [ ] Remove the `Cow<'a, str>`s in function signatures for `&str`s
    - [x] Remodel Prefix into UserPrefix AND Prefix
	- [ ] Write a lot of tests
        - [ ] Write property tests
    - [ ] Wrap the `Tokens` enum into some trait, so we can pass them around.
	- [ ] Find parallelization opportunities
    - [ ] Add a macro to build your own scheme at compile time:
    - [ ] Build an interface to dynamically construct a scheme at runtime, with
      the values being most likely lazy static
